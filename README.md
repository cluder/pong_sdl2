# pong_sdl2
A simple Pong game made with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/), [SDL ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf), [SDL image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image), [SDL mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer) (c++)

The player controls the left paddle, the right is controled by a very simple a.i.
When the ```static bool playerDisabled``` flag is set to true, two a.i.'s play vs. each other.
